# Recovery_algorithm

Codes to reproduce resilience curves from: 
a. Bhatia.U.,Udit Bhatia, Devashish Kumar, Evan Kodra, Auroop R. Ganguly " Network Science Based Quantification of Resilience Demonstrated on the Indian Railways Network".
b. Sela L. Bhatia U., Zhuang J., Ganguly A.R, " Resilience Strategies for Interdependent Multiscale Lifeline Infrastructure Networks".
1. Clone or download the repository from Github.
2. Add the downloaded folder to MATLAB path.
3. Import the required datasets in your matlab environment. Three datasets: Indian Railways, US National Airspace, and Boston's Mass Transit System datasets are available to be used out of the box. 
3. Run resilience_CIR.m using the instructions provided in comments of the script file.
4. Enjoy!
